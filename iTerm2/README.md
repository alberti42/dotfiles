# Dynamic profiles

If you want to use dynamic profiles such as those stored in the file `iTerm2_dynamic_profiles.json`, add a symbolic link to this file in the folder	`~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/DynamicProfiles`.

Dynamics profiles cannot be edited in the editor. However, they may be useful to trigger changes from outside, depending on the environment. I decided that they are less convenient, and will no longer use them. The `.json` file remains but won't be synchronized with the latest changes.
